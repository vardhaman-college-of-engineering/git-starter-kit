# GIT Cheat Sheet
      
## init — Create an empty GIT repository in your development directory

Go to directory
#### git init
 

## status — Show the current state of the repository including un-added and un-committed files

#### git status
 

## add — Add a file to the repository staging area

Create a file, e.g. file.txt
#### git add file.txt

Add all new or changed files to the repository staging area (the period means all)

#### git add .
 

## commit — Commit all changes to the repository for first time (-m means message)

#### git commit –m “Initial commit”
Commit all changes to the repository for later activities

#### git commit –m “Description of changes being made to project”
 

## branch — Create a new branch of the project

Choose a name for the new branch (original branch is master), e.g. test
#### git branch test

List all branches (* appears next to current branch)

#### git branch
 

## checkout — Switch branches and check-out all files (e.g. to test branch)

#### git checkout test
Create a new branch and check-out files in one command

#### git checkout –b test
 

## merge — Merge two branches together (go to the destination branch first, e.g. master)

#### git checkout master
#### git merge test
 

## (delete) — Delete a branch that you no longer need (e.g. after a merge)

#### git branch test –d
Or to force the delete:

#### git branch test –D
 

## log — View commit history (including long commit ID numbers)

#### git log
 

## revert — Revert all files back to a previous commit point

#### git revert <long commit ID from the log command>

#### rm -cache

Removes cache from a specific file so that it can be added to the .gitignore
